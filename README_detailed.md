## Step-by-Step Instructions for Beginners

### Step 1: Understand What We're Doing

**Goal**: We are setting up a monitoring solution for a distributed microservices architecture using several popular open-source tools. These tools will help us:
- **Monitor system performance**.
- **Visualize metrics** in dashboards.
- **Collect logs** to understand what's happening.
- **Trace requests** to see how they travel through different services.

The tools we are using are:
- **Prometheus** (collect metrics)
- **Grafana** (visualize metrics)
- **Jaeger** (trace requests)
- **Fluentd** (collect and forward logs)

### Step 2: Tools and Requirements

Before we dive into the steps, we need a few things ready:
- **Kubernetes**: This is where we'll deploy all the services. If you haven't already, set up a Kubernetes cluster (you can use Minikube for local testing).
- **kubectl**: This is the command-line tool that helps you talk to Kubernetes.
- **Docker**: This is used to manage and run the services in containers.

### Step 3: Extract the ZIP File

First, unzip the file that you downloaded (`monitoring-solution.zip`). Inside, you will see a structure like this:

```
monitoring-solution/
├── prometheus/
├── grafana/
├── jaeger/
├── fluentd/
└── kubernetes/
```

Each of these files contains the configurations we need to deploy these services. Don't worry if these names sound confusing, I’ll walk you through them.

### Step 4: Deploy the Tools to Kubernetes

#### 4.1 Set Up Prometheus

- **Prometheus** is used to collect metrics from all the services.

1. **Apply Prometheus Configurations**:
   - Open a terminal in the folder where you unzipped the files.
   - Run the following commands to set up Prometheus:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f prometheus/prometheus.yml
     kubectl apply -f prometheus/deployment.yml
     ```
   - **What this does**: Prometheus starts running in your Kubernetes cluster. It will collect metrics from the other services that are running.

#### 4.2 Set Up Grafana

- **Grafana** helps visualize the metrics that Prometheus collects in nice, easy-to-understand dashboards.

1. **Apply Grafana Configurations**:
   - In the terminal, run the following commands to set up Grafana:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f grafana/grafana-datasources.yml
     kubectl apply -f grafana/deployment.yml
     ```
   - **What this does**: Grafana is deployed, and it’s automatically configured to get data from Prometheus.

#### 4.3 Set Up Jaeger

- **Jaeger** is a tool for tracing requests as they travel through multiple services. This helps us understand where delays might be happening.

1. **Apply Jaeger Configuration**:
   - Run this command in the terminal:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f jaeger/deployment.yml
     ```
   - **What this does**: Jaeger is deployed in the cluster, and it will collect tracing data to help you troubleshoot performance problems across services.

#### 4.4 Set Up Fluentd

- **Fluentd** collects logs from all services, making it easier to see errors and warnings from different parts of the system in one place.

1. **Apply Fluentd Configuration**:
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f fluentd/fluentd-configmap.yml
     kubectl apply -f fluentd/deployment.yml
     ```
   - **What this does**: Fluentd is deployed to gather logs from your services and forward them to Elasticsearch or another log storage.

### Step 5: Deploy a Sample Microservice and Set Up Autoscaling

- Now we need a service to actually monitor. You will deploy a simple **microservice**.

1. **Deploy the Microservice**:
   - Run this command:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f kubernetes/microservice.yml
     ```
   - **What this does**: This deploys a sample microservice that will be used to generate some data for our monitoring setup.

2. **Set Up Autoscaling**:
   - Run this command to enable autoscaling for the microservice:
     ```
     kubectl apply -f kubernetes/horizontal-pod-autoscaler.yml
     ```
   - **What this does**: This configures Kubernetes to automatically add more instances of the microservice if it starts getting too busy.

### Step 6: Access the Monitoring Tools

Once everything is set up, you need to check that all tools are working:

1. **Grafana**:
   - Find out how to access Grafana by running:
     ```
     kubectl get service grafana
     ```
   - **NodePort** will be shown in the output. Open your browser and go to `http://<node-ip>:<node-port>` to view Grafana dashboards.

2. **Prometheus**:
   - Prometheus can also be accessed in a similar way:
     ```
     kubectl get service prometheus
     ```
   - Open in the browser to explore the metrics that Prometheus has gathered.

3. **Jaeger**:
   - To access Jaeger, run:
     ```
     kubectl get service jaeger
     ```
   - Use the address to open Jaeger’s UI and view traces of requests between services.

### Step 7: Verify Alerts and Logging

- Prometheus is configured with **alerts** that will notify you if something goes wrong. You can view these alert configurations in Prometheus UI.
- **Fluentd** is forwarding logs to a centralized log management system, such as **Elasticsearch**. Make sure you have Elasticsearch configured to receive the logs if you want to see them.

### Step 8: What You Should See

- **Grafana Dashboards**: You’ll be able to see various metrics, such as CPU usage, request rate, and error rate.
- **Jaeger Traces**: You’ll be able to see the paths requests take through your microservices and identify where any slowdowns occur.
- **Logs**: Logs from different services will be aggregated so you can view them all in one place.

### Step 9: Key Points to Remember

- **Prometheus** scrapes data from microservices.
- **Grafana** helps you visualize this data in dashboards.
- **Jaeger** helps trace the path of requests through different services.
- **Fluentd** collects logs and forwards them to a storage backend for analysis.

### Common Problems and Solutions

- **Services Not Found**: Make sure all services are running by using `kubectl get pods`.
- **Access Issues**: If you can’t access Grafana, Prometheus, or Jaeger, make sure the NodePort services are open and accessible from your machine.
- **Metrics Missing**: If Grafana dashboards are empty, verify that Prometheus is scraping metrics correctly.

## Notes
- Ensure that the endpoints for Prometheus targets and other configurations match your actual service setup.
- Customize the image paths and service names as per your environment.
